# Face to Emoji
Trained a CNN classifier to classify 7 differnt emotions, we used FER-2013 dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/msambare/fer2013). We then used OpenCV's Haarcascade classifier to detect faces from the incoming video stream and predict their emotions. At last we created mask of the emojis similar to the predicted emotions and applied it on the face region.
